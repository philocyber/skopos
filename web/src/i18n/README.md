# Interface localization

The interface is English-only. A single locale provider keeps the static
English export and the first client render consistent; the locale preference
persists in `skopos.locale` localStorage and the `skopos_locale` cookie, and API
transport reads it before hydration finishes. (The locale plumbing is retained
so a second language can be reintroduced later without reworking consumers.)

Use `useI18n().t` in components and `translate` in non-React helpers. Keep
placeholders identical and pass user values as interpolation parameters. Never
translate user-entered text, persisted reports, identifiers, API field names,
credentials, or protocol values. The mention wire tokens (`@[finding#12 ...]`)
are a stable backend contract and must match `server/chat_mentions.go`
byte-for-byte if ever changed; the legacy `[模型]`/`Model` and `工具 ... 请求`
historical-data markers remain upstream-ARTEX compatibility values;
visible labels are localized independently.

The `interface` namespace contains the migrated interface and authored demo
messages, with stable IDs. The `english` namespace covers pre-existing English
interface labels. New features should use descriptive keys in an appropriate
namespace. Static configuration objects expose localized labels through getters.
Consumers subscribe to the locale, and memoized derived labels include the locale
dependency. Language changes do not remount the application or clear drafts.

`localizedFetch` adds locale headers and query parameters while retaining caller
headers. SSE URLs use `sseUrl`, which adds the locale query parameter. Use
`getIntlLocale` or the `fmt` helpers for dates and numbers.

`prepareDemoFixture` runs only on authored initial demo fixtures. It makes their
text reactive. Editing a fixture replaces its accessor with an ordinary writable
value; `cloneDemoFixture` preserves this distinction, so edits are never
retranslated, even when their text matches a catalog entry.

Run `npm test` from `web` for regression tests plus catalog completeness,
interpolation, persistence/hydration, transport, editable fixtures, legacy
mention compatibility, formatting, and AST-aware Han coverage. The coverage test
allows only explicitly documented legacy parsing and multilingual test data. It
also checks that source and build-configuration comments are English. Run
`npx tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build:static` for compilation and export
verification.
