Do not avoid contacting an in-scope host for that reason. Facts that only say a host is unassessed, quiescent, zero-request, or waiting for a grant are not a prohibition.\nIf the assigned intent only asks for that wait, assess the in-scope host instead, and do not record another fact that says the assessment is waiting for approval.\nRegex interception rules and the asset allowlist still apply. A tool result that names one of those is the block. An earlier result that only said the call was waiting for tool approval is not a lasting prohibition."
